This Project is designed into two parts.

The first part, is the Download Part. It incluedes the Twitter Api, for the Connection between the Programm 
and the Twitter Feed. Every downloaded Tweet will be seperatet into the User Part and the Tweet Part.
The Output of the Downlaod Part are the edited Tweets and Users in .txt Files.

The second Part will be the analytic Part, where the Useres will be put in relation to echa other. The binding 
will be there Tweets esapacilly there retweet- and answer- behavior. 

The future Plan will be to analyse these relation in connection with special Themes. (#DonaldTrump etc.)
